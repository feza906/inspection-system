# Take-Home Test: Vehicle Inspection System

A full-stack vehicle inspection management system using React + TypeScript (frontend) and Express + TypeScript (backend).

**Recommended Time: around 2 hours** — You may take as long as you need, but please don't overthink it.

---

## Backend Tasks (`/backend`)

### Task 1: Implement `createCheck` controller

The `POST /checks` endpoint controller is not implemented. You need to:

1. Validate request body using `validateCheckRequest(req.body)`
2. Return 400 with `ErrorResponse` format if validation fails
3. Call `checkService.createCheck()` if validation passes
4. Return 201 with the created check

**Verify:** Remove `.skip` from the test `"should create check and return 201"` in `api.test.ts`

### Task 2: Fix the bug in service function `createCheck`

The `hasIssue` flag is not correctly identifying if an inspection record has an issue. Find and fix the bug.

**Verify:** Remove `.skip` from the test `"should set hasIssue to true when any item fails"` in `api.test.ts`

Run `npm test` — all tests should pass.

### Task 3: Complete `deleteCheck` controller

The `DELETE /checks/:id` endpoint is not completed. It will not process the deletion and will return `501` regardless of the success or failure of the deletion. Complete this controller and related service function if applicable.

## Frontend Tasks (`/frontend`)

### Task 1: Fix Form Input

Check the form (of Submit Vehicle Inspection Result) to make sure the fields are accepting valid input and address any other bugs.

### Task 2: Change dropdown selection for checklist items

In the form, instead of a dropdown to select the result for checklist items, change them to checkboxes, radio buttons, or any other input type that you think is suitable.

### Task 3: Add Notes Field

In the form, add a textarea for optional notes:

- Maximum 300 characters
- (Optional) Display character counter (e.g., "45/300")
- Include in API request and reset after submission

### Task 4: Implement Toast Notifications

**File:** `src/CheckForm.tsx`

Show visual feedback using the provided `Toast.tsx` and `useToast.ts`:

- Success toast on successful submission
- Error toast on failure
- (Optional) Show a good error message in toast on failure

### Task 5: (Optional) Implement a way to delete an inspection record

Note that this task is **completely optional** and we do not expect you to finish this. However, if you wish, you can implement a way to delete an inspection record, provided that you have completed the `deleteCheck` controller. We will provide feedback if you choose to complete this task.
